# Artwork Extractor (awe)

awe can be used to extract artwork from mp3, m4a, ... audio files and save
it to a particular file in each folder.

I am using the Synology AudioStation to play music in my local environment
and found that AudioStation ignores many of the embedded cover artwork.
One solution to that is to extract the cover artwork and to save it as
`folder.jpg` or `cover.jpg` to the album's folder.

awe will do exactly that.
